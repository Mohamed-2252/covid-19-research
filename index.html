  </div>
  <div class="box animonItem" id="half"  data-effect=" ">COVID-19 is similar to the other viruses. Viruses are non-living organisms; however, they have their own genetic materials and program that are capable of redirecting the cell machinery to replicate and live inside the cell and also, they can transfer from one organism to another as transferring from animals such as cats and camels to human by host-switching, which appeared in many diseases such as influenza, smallpox, and HIV. Coronavirus is composed of RNA, wrapped with protein, a lipid membrane, and a spiky protein surface that help the virus to fuse with cell receptors.<br>
    COVID-19 invades the respiratory system especially the alveolar epithelial through ACE2 receptor, then it enters the cell as an uncoated virus with a positive RNA genome, then it uses the host’s ribosomes to translate it into proteins that are necessary for making RNA polymerase that will make new RNA negative strand and the negative strand will create a positive one, then the RNA strands will be read by the endoplasmic reticulum to make necessary components of the virus and send them to the Golgi apparatus to package them up with the positive strand and form new viruses, then they exit the cell by exocytosis after damaging the cell, after that the immune system invades those cells as a response for the cytokines secreted by the damaged cells, and the macrophages themselves secrete different types of cytokines, the inflammatory process, that occurs in the parenchyma in the alveoli, stimulates nerve endings causing the initiation of the reflex cough. </div>

  </div>
  <div class="box " id="half"  data-effect=" "> The symptoms of coronaviruses vary from mild to severe symptoms since 2002, those symptoms usually appear after the incubation period of the disease which extends between 2-14 days, and they can be represented in fever or chills, dry cough, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, loss of taste or smell, shortness and difficulty in breathing, but in severe conditions, the disease causes pneumonia.<br>
    <br>Diagnosis of COVID-19<br>
There are many tests used for the detection of coronavirus, however, the recommended and direct test to detect its presence is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which depends on the extraction of the viral RNA in swaps taken from the nose or the mouth by adding buffer, then convert the viral RNA to DNA by reverse transcription, after that multiple copies of the viral DNA are made, finally the sample is detected by real-time fluorescent PCR analyzer (RT-PCR instrument). There is another test which is an indirect test, that detects the presence of antibodies of coronavirus to know if the virus has infected the body or not, and it also determines the strength of your immune system and its defense, but this test isn’t always true and it has relatively low accuracy than the RT-PCR, which is very accurate, sensitive, but it takes a longer time.

  </div>
  <div class="box " id="half"  data-effect=" ">The recent Covid-19 pandemic has had significant psychological and social effects on the population. Research has highlighted the impact on the psychological well-being of the most exposed groups, including children, college students, and health workers, who are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms of distress. It has a drastic effect on people with special needs. Even at the best of times, persons with disabilities face challenges in accessing healthcare services, due to lack of availability, accessibility, affordability, as well as stigma and discrimination. The risks of infection from COVID-19 for persons with disabilities are compounded by other issues, which warrant specific action: disruption of services and support, pre-existing health conditions in some cases which leave them more at risk of developing serious illness or dying, being excluded from health information and mainstream health provision, living in a world where accessibility is often limited and where barriers to goods and services are a challenge, and being disproportionately more likely to live in institutional settings. General individual self-care and other preventive measures against the COVID-19 outbreak can entail challenges for persons with disabilities. For instance, some persons with disabilities may have difficulties in implementing measures to keep the virus at bay, including personal hygiene and recommended frequent cleaning of surfaces and homes. Cleaning homes and washing hands frequently can be challenging, due to physical impairments, environmental barriers, or interrupted services. Others may not be able to practice social distancing or cannot isolate themselves as thoroughly as other people, because they require regular help and support from other people for everyday self-care tasks. As the coronavirus pandemic rapidly sweeps across the world, it is inducing a considerable degree of fear, worry, and concern in the population at large and among certain groups in particular, such as older adults, care providers, and people with underlying health conditions.<br>
    In public mental health terms, the main psychological impact to date is elevated rates of stress or anxiety. But as new measures and impacts are introduced – especially quarantine and its effects on many people’s usual activities, routines, or livelihoods – levels of loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol, and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behavior are also expected to rise.

  <h2 class="animonItem" id="only" data-effect=" "><i class="fas fa-school"></i> Covid-19 impact on education: </h2><br>
  </div>
  <div class="box " id="half"  data-effect=" ">COVID-19 had a positive and a negative impact on education.
    Let start with the dark side, so in the whole world, there is a billion students who are unable to go to school or university, due to measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. According to the latest figures released by UNESCO, some 1.3 billion learners worldwide weren’t able to attend school or university as of March 23, 2020. 
<br>
The primary point of being in school is that it increases a child’s ability, social skills, and social awareness. Even a relatively short time in school does this; even a relatively short period of missed school will have consequences for skill growth. Many students do not have access to computers or the internet in their homes. children haven’t generally been sent home to play but to continue their education at home. Some parents can make their children learn very well at home but this seems unlikely to generalize over the whole population. That because some parents maybe didn’t understand all the things that their children are studying and it’s difficult to help your child learn something that you may not understand on your own, it will lead to an increase in inequality among students.
<br>Covid 19 also affects the assessments of learners, as many tests have been postponed or canceled, and the goal of these assessments of all kinds is to verify that learners receive the information properly, so canceling assessments will lead to bad consequences such as losing information and not installing it and will have consequences for the learner in long term.
But there is a good side of the impacts of COVID-19 on education: There are many online educational platforms that have been advertising-free educational tools for students around the world who are isolated at home due to COVID-19. 
<br>And because the study is transformed from a face-to-face study on the ground to virtual classes, so it makes students more aware of technology and how to use it, some students face a problem in dealing with technology, but they quickly adapt to it and it becomes easy and this increases their experience.<br>The focus on online and distance education makes affordable programs known to the public. The shift to technology platforms also provides new opportunities for students and educators to experience different forms of education.
<br>More than 25.3 million students have been affected by the closure of schools in Egypt to limit the spread of the Corona pandemic. And these disturbances in the educational system may affect the behavioral and social development of students. Poor families face a problem in the inability of their children to learn from online distance learning, such as the lack of internet for them or the lack of the devices such as laptops and computers which the students will learn through these. But online distance learning also teaches Egyptian students how to deal with modern technology and learn more about dealing with electronic devices in a useful way, such as studying and taking courses.

  </div>
  <div class="box " id="half"  data-effect=" ">Covid 19 kept us at home all-time in addition to stopping transportation and closing factories and companies. So, our lives were on hold. Also, the economics of some countries were collapsed instead of growing. Despite this, the nature and environment were the first to benefit from the cessation of human activities.<br>
   <br> Positive environmental effects of covid-19<br>
    There is a lot of positive impacts that covid-19 has brought to the environment. Through satellite images published by NASA and the European Space Agency, a decrease in China's nitrogen dioxide emissions by nearly 30% compared to the previous five-year average., mostly from fossil fuel use, was observed in January and February. Also, the nitrogen dioxide levels fell by more than 30%. This resulted from the economic slowdown that this country faced, during the quarantine period. Also, Carbon dioxide emissions, that caused by the use of fossil fuels, also decreased, by 25 percent due to the measures taken to contain the pandemic outbreak of the Coronavirus. But, after the collapsing of the economy of some countries as a result of the complete closures during the Corona pandemic, some countries gradually reopened airports and restored the movement of transportation, which led to an increase in the proportion of nitrogen dioxide again, as shown in the first figure, after its emissions had decreased by a large percentage.
    In Italy, data from satellite imagery showed that nitrogen dioxide emissions have also decreased in the north of the country, and waterways in cities appear cleaner, due to the massive decrease in tourist boat traffic.

<br>In the great lakes region, scientists observed that there is a slight increase in the rate of chlorophyll-a and suspended sediment concentrations in the Western Basin of Lake Erie, which considered the most affected lake part by human activities and agriculture. Research is ongoing, however, as scientists are unsure whether these changes are due to COVID-19 related behavioral changes or no.
<br>In India, the curfew that was imposed across the country on the 22nd of March, caused the level of nitrogen dioxide pollution to reach its lowest levels during the spring.
<br>Some animals have the opportunity to discover the world in the absence of humans. The lack of traffic on the streets saved the young animals, who began to wake up from their hibernation-like hedgehogs, from being run over under the wheels of cars.
<br>In Egypt <br>It was confirmed by official government announcements that the environmental noise level in Egypt had decreased by about 75% during the lockdown period.
<br>The lockdown period had affected the air pollution levels in Egypt with a focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4%. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates.<br>
<br>Negative environmental effects of covid-19 <br>
Covid 19 has a negative impact on the environment. One of the negative effects of the pandemic is the significant increase in plastic waste, from medical gloves to packaging. The reason for this is due to people's trend towards packaged and prepackaged diets. Even the cafes that used to encourage customers to bring their cups in order to save on plastic cups that are harmful to the environment, stopped doing this for fear of spreading infection.
<br>Biomedical waste (BMW) production from COVID-19 patients is increasing worldwide. India produces approximately 550 tons of biomedical waste (BMW) annually which is only treated by 198 joint biomedical waste treatment facilities and 225 captive incinerators. During the pandemic in Wuhan, China, it was reported that the city produced 240 tons of Additional medical waste per day.
<br>In Egypt <br> There are some negative effects, one of them is an increase in solid medical waste (from 70 to 300 tons/day).</div>

  <h2 class="animonItem" id="only" data-effect=" "><i class="fas fa-comments-dollar"></i> Coronavirus effects on the economy:</h2><br>
  </div>
  <div class="box " id="half"  data-effect=" ">The global economy was severely affected by the implementation of large-scale containment measures by governments to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Many people have lost their jobs, or their incomes cut. Also, Unemployment rates have increased across major economies.
    The tourism and travel sector were the most affected among the economic sectors, due to the cessation of flights and the closing of many countries to their borders, especially in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Also, there have been major disruptions in other economic sectors, such as trade, energy, and finance.
    Global financial markets have been severely affected by the effects of the spread of COVID-19. With the number of cases increasing globally, mainly through the United States, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Iran, and South Korea, the global financial and oil markets have collapsed since the beginning of 2020, So, the US stock market and European indices (S&P 500, FTSE 100, CAC 40, DAX) has been lost a quarter of its value, with oil prices down more than 65% as of April 24, 2020.
    coronavirus has unevenly impacted global food supply chains. In higher-income countries with more isolated agricultural communities and less intensive cultivation techniques, the virus's spread has had a minimal effect on key staple crops like wheat, maize, rice, and soybeans. Also, in some middle and lower-income countries where mandatory shelter-in-place orders have strained the cultivation of labor-intensive crops, the U.N. World Food Program estimated that the pandemic could double the number of people facing acute food shortages by the end of 2020.
    <br>Coronavirus effects on Egypt’s economy<br>
    the decrease in global trade and the movement of transport due to the pandemic negatively affected the revenues of the Suez Canal amounting to about $ 6 billion, also the oil-related war and its effects also affect Egypt, besides increasing the prices of incoming goods to Egypt, where Egypt is a large market for importing Goods from abroad.
    The annual growth rate of GDP in the third quarter of 2019/2020 decreased by 0.6% from its counterpart in 2018/2019, which was 5% in 2019/2020 compared to 5.6% in 2018/2019.
    The rate of change in producer prices witnessed a continuous collapse during the period February-April 2020, and the annual rate of decline became 18.8% at the end of the period. This decline is attributed to the decline in the prices of agricultural, fishing, mining, quarrying, food, and accommodation services by 4.5%, 67.7%, and 8.1%, respectively.
    Net international reserves decreased by $9.5 billion during the period from February to May 2020.<br>
    Monthly net international reserves decline with the outbreak of the pandemic in Egypt, the monthly decline rates were about 11.9%, 7.7% in March and April 2020, before that rate decreased to 2.8% in May 2020.
The annual rate of change of non-oil merchandise imports (in US dollars) witnessed its greatest decrease since January 2019 in the months of February, April, and May 2020 at rates of 25.5%, 35.0%, and 35.8%, respectively. While the annual rate of change of non-oil merchandise exports (in US dollars) decreased by 19.9% and 36.0% in April and May 2020, respectively.

  <h2 class="animonItem" id="only" data-effect=" "><i class="fab fa-medrt"></i> Vaccinations:</h2><br>
  </div>
  <div class="box animonItem" id="half"  data-effect=" ">There are 3 types of vaccinations The first one is the Messenger RNA vaccine. This vaccine uses genetically engineered mRNA to give your cells instructions for how to make the S protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. After vaccination, your immune cells begin making the S protein pieces and displaying them on cell surfaces. This causes your body to create antibodies. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, these antibodies will fight the virus. After delivering instructions, the mRNA is immediately broken down. It never enters the nucleus of your cells, where your DNA is kept. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna use this method. The second one is the Vector vaccine. Genetic material from the COVID-19 virus is placed in a modified version of a different virus (viral vector). When the viral vector gets into your cells, it delivers genetic material from the COVID-19 virus that gives your cells instructions to make copies of the S protein. Once your cells display the S proteins on their surfaces, your immune system responds by creating antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus. But do not worry, the genetic material that's delivered doesn't become part of your DNA. The Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is a vector vaccine. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford also have a vector COVID-19 vaccine. The final one is the Protein subunit vaccine. Subunit vaccines include only the parts of a virus that best stimulate your immune system. This type of COVID-19 vaccine contains harmless S proteins. Once your immune system recognizes the S proteins, it creates antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus. COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID-19. You may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. These side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Common side effects: On the arm where you got the shot: • Pain • Redness • Swelling Throughout the rest of your body: • Tiredness • Headache • Muscle pain • Chills • Fever • Nausea .div>
